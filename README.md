# MinecraftRCONpasswordCracker
If you lost your password to your Minecraft server and have default RCON, this script is for you!
# What is it?
The code tries out many passwords for your Minecraft server's Remote Console.
# How does it work?
If a Minecraft server has RCON open (they often have, for remote management), that default, Mojang-made RCON does not have ANY password bruteforce.
<br> That means most servers, even large ones, are VERY VULNREABLE.
<br> I will make a Minecraft RCON bruteforce protection repository in the future.
